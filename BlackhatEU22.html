   <p>
    As a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast, I've always been eager to attend conferences that would help me grow and learn more about the field. When I got the chance to attend the Blackhat Europe Conference in London, I couldn't contain my excitement! From engaging talks and workshops to incredible networking opportunities, the event was nothing short of spectacular. The scale of everything made other conferences feel miniscule in comparison!
</p>

<h2>Talks and Workshops</h2>
<p>
    The conference featured an array of talks and workshops on various cybersecurity topics, including new vulnerabilities, exploits, and emerging threats and trends. A few standout presentations included Matt Wixey's talk on 'Scammers Who Scam Scammers', where he detailed the art of counter-attacking online scammers (and how quick and careless they can be to throw other people under the bus!), and Ragnhild Bridget Sageng's talk on 'The Aftermath of a Social Engineering Pentest', which shed light on the consequences of a social engineering attack. We often think about finding vulnerabilities and submitting a report with our finding - but it was interesting to hear the range of implications this can have for employees.
</p>

<h2>Policy-Related Discussions</h2>
<p>
    One of the aspects I found particularly interesting at the conference was the focus on policy-related discussions. Cybersecurity is not just about technology; it also involves legal and regulatory aspects that are vital to ensuring a safe digital environment. The conference provided a platform for thought-provoking debates on how to effectively incorporate policy in cybersecurity strategies and bridge the gap between the technical and legal domains. As some companies are choosing to involve themselves in the process behind creating policy, this could lead to interesting changes in the future. Many companies are frustrated by being hamstrung through policy and regulation, from people without the knowledge and expertise. Therefore a coming together to get a set of standards that will benefit more people and be more inclusive of opinions from all sides can surely only lead to more effective policy being implemented.
</p>

<h2>Networking Opportunities</h2>
<p>
    The Blackhat Europe Conference offered exceptional networking opportunities, allowing me to connect with professionals, researchers, and fellow enthusiasts in the cybersecurity field. It was inspiring to exchange ideas and experiences with like-minded individuals who share the same passion for cybersecurity. The connections I made at the conference are invaluable, and I look forward to future collaborations and knowledge-sharing with my new acquaintances.
</p>

<h2>The Network Operations Centre (NOC) at Blackhat EU22 London</h2>
<p>
    One of the highlights of the event was the Network Operations Centre (NOC). The NOC served as the central hub for monitoring and managing the event's network infrastructure, ensuring a secure and stable environment for all attendees. It was fascinating to observe how the team behind the scenes worked tirelessly to address any potential security issues and maintain the seamless functioning of the conference's digital infrastructure.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    Attending the Blackhat Europe Conference was an amazing opportunity, and I am grateful to Black Hat for selecting me as one of the 94 scholars. A huge thank you goes to Jamie O'Hare for encouraging me to apply for the scholarship. I also want to extend my thanks to my fellow Abertay University students and the Abertay Ethical Hacking Society members for their wonderful company during the conference.
</p>
<p>
    The Blackhat Europe Conference was a truly enriching experience that has broadened my horizons in the field of cybersecurity. I eagerly anticipate the chance to attend future events and highly recommend other people apply to attend too (even if this lowers my chances!).
