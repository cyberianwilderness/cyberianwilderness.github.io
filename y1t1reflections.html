                        Returning to university as a (slightly) more mature student is both exciting and nerve wrecking. 
                        Considering I have no prior experience in Cybersecurity, being a teacher before - I am living embodiment that no experience is required!<br>
                        Here’s an overview what the first term in Abertay entailed. </p>  <p>Please also keep in mind that I am relatively new when it comes to coding, cyber and computing in general! 
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">So what modules/classes did I have this term? </h2>
                    <p> 
                        This academic aspect of this semester can be divided into three main chunks, Online electives and two in-person/normal modules called 'Introduction to C++' and 'CHAOS'. 
					</p>
                    <p> 
						The are four online modules which are mandatory for all first year undergraduates at Abertay, one of which is mandatory for everyone. 
                        We then selected our three remaining online modules from a choice of seven which aim to develop many of the areas that are fundamental to success as a student including academic writing, research skills, career planning, digital skills, and strategies for maintaining your mental wellbeing. 
                        Let’s move on to the two modules.
					</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction to C++</h2>
                    
                    <p>
						The programming language that we have been introduced to first as part of course is C++.  Apologies if you are a seasoned programmer (please remember when you were at this point), however being introduced to the basic programming constructs has been very beneficial to get me to a point where I feel comfortable working with C++ 
						and can begin to read a code with at least a vague understanding of what is going on!
                    </p>
                    <p>
						We looked at functions, loops, arrays, conditional statements, switches, references, and pointers. 
						Personally, it has been rewarding to get to grips with the fundamentals of C++. 
						The learning process for me, like many others I assume (and hope!) is that I explore a new construct, build a range of programs that use these features in a variety of ways and then learn from the deluge of errors and complaints by the compiler I received. 
						Once I navigated past the frustration of errors via sheer iteration, I started to piece together an understanding of how some of the fundamentals of C++ behave. 
                    </p>
                    
                      <h3 class="post-subtitle">Why C++ and not Python, C#, Java or the myriad of coding languages that are available today?</h3> 
                    
                    <p>
						A quick search on forums online would appear many professionals/hobbyists have very differing views about what language is best and which language you should start with! 
						I am sure every language has their merits that I will encounter when I am introduced to them, but my first impressions are that C++ is transferrable to C, very powerful and it is a language that does not ‘hold your hand’ through the coding process. 
						I’m not sure if it would be described as user friendly for someone new to coding, so having lecturers to guide us through C++ has been extremely beneficial. 
						It should also be factored in that the lecturers, whom have far more expertise, have also selected C++ as the first programming language we will be formally taught.
			</p>
                  
			<p>
						To explain coding to those who have no or very limited experience, I would compare it to learning to write in another language. 
						Think of the computer as <b>an extremely literal person who needs to be told exactly what to do</b>, with no room for nuance or figurative speech! 
						Coding is an extremely logical method of creating something, but you must adapt to how the computer will interpret your code. 
						In many ways this prcoess mimics learning another language and to properly convey your exact point you need to use grammar (or in the case of coding, syntax) accurately.
						You might be able to say something you think is correct, similar to how you can code something you think will work but getting the computer to understand exactly what you mean is akin to getting a native speaker to have full comprehension of what you want to say, which depends on getting the grammar bang on. 
						The devil is in the detail as they say!
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">CHAOS</h2>
                    
                    <blockquote>Chaos, defined as "complete confusion and disorder: a state in which behaviour and events are not controlled by anything". <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chaos">(Merriam-Webster) </a> </blockquote> 
                    <p>
						You’d be forgiven for thinking the above definition perfectly encapsulates my feelings during this term (particularly someone being thrown into the deep end of computing)! 
						Thankfully it is an acronym for Computer Hardware Architecture and Operating Systems and not me describing how this term has been at Abertay! 
						As important as it is to interact with computer software and develop programs through code, it is critical that we understand how computers work under the hood and even what ‘computing’ is. Some of the areas we delved into were: <br>
						When were the first machines capable of computing invented?
						<br>
						What constitutes a computer? 
			    			<br>
			    			What is the minimum capability/spec required to classify a device as a computer?
						<br>
						When we load up a computer, what sequence of operations take place to get from switching it on to having a graphical interface we can interact with? 
						<br>
						What is memory – how is data accessed, stored and manipulated?
			</p>
			<p>
						Perhaps the most engaging and fun aspect of this module was the practical ask, building ‘something interesting’ Using a Lolin WEMOS D1R2 & Mini hardware kits we were given. 
						This was our chance to put into practice what we had learned about circuits and start using the Arduino IDE application. For the code in this project, we were able to write our code in C++ on Arduino IDE (another reason why we learn it first), with the challenge being to implement as many features as we could to get as strong a grade as possible.
						The features included using a range of components (e.g. buzzers, OLED screens, potentiometers and many more) and learning how to implement these components together in a creative and interactive project using Arduino IDE.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What’s it been like as a (slightly more) mature student?</h2>
                    <p> 
						Probably my biggest worry ahead of returning to higher education. I’m almost thirty and had visions that everyone else would be in their late teens so I would stand out like a sore thumb! 
						My last 5 years have been spent teaching children instead of vice versa for other students on my lecturers, so our outlook on various issues could be potentially polarised! 
						Much to my delight it has been a very smooth transition process back to full time study.
						<br> <br>
						To those who are considering a career change, sometimes retraining is a less desirable option due to finances and the length of time it may take, but if you are passionate about an area then it certainly can be a valid option. 
						The change to a new social environment has been no different to adapting to a new job/new office, and as much as patterns and familiarity provide comfort, branching out it something new has so far felt like a successful choice. 
						<br>
						If you are considering studying cyber, coming to Abertay or going back to university as a more mature student (yes, I can sense some of you would consider under 30 not mature at all!) and have any questions then please e-mail me any questions you have, and I will endeavour to answer them as best I can!
